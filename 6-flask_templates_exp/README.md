# 6-flask_templates_exp project

More experiments with flask.

Note that these experiments build on what we did in ../5-flask_test_drive .

## Reference:

Continuing with playing around with examples from the "Flask Web Development" book, this time from Chapter 3.

## Goal:

Determine whether switching groja.com to flask would enable us to keep the navigation,
and other elements common to all pages, DRY.

These options seem to work ok, and the -h option makes it the site available from other hosts - good to know!
