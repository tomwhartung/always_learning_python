For information about installing django and setting up the required virtual environments, etc. see ../README.md .

For information about how to use startproject, startapp, etc. see the ../0-hello_world/startproject subdirectory.

## static_image_gallery - goals

Keep in mind that the main goal is get a django site running on my server, no matter how simplistic, asap.

1. Learn how to get views.py and urls.py to work together
2. Have something minimal to host at groja.com
3. Lay the mental groundwork for building something that uses models or PIP or both

#### For future reference

Googling for python image gallery tutorials I found some links which may be useful for the next project.

Having vetted some of the search results and identified these as interesting, just thought that I'd save them here.

* http://eflorenzano.com/blog/2006/12/20/writing-gallery-app-part-one/  ## lots of information about models, that looks good
* http://grasshopperpebbles.com/django-python/creating-a-photo-gallery-with-django-and-jquery/  ## mobile-friendly, using jQueryMoble(!?)

Not tutorials but look to be useful:

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11166156/how-to-create-a-django-image-gallery
* https://github.com/samuelmh/django-smh_gallery

But seriously, first things first, and that is hosting a minimal django site.

## Requirements

This is part of groja.com , which has its own repository.

For the requirements for this project, see the (https://github.com/tomwhartung/groja.com)[groja.com README.md file].

### Design

Most of the site's design is determined by django.

* Single project: `static_image_gallery`
* Single app: `groja_gallery`

Views: TBD.

### MasterPlan

Be mindful that the MasterPlan is to do something very similar using Node.js and React, to compare the two.

For example, be on the lookout for opportunities to share non-react-dependent JavaScript, HTML, or CSS between the two!

**Don't forget the MasterPlan!!**
