# 24-bootstrap_4_test_drive

Repo for trying out using bootstrap 4, now in its alpha 6 release.

## References

This post, dated a few months ago, says the next release will be a beta:

* http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2017/01/06/bootstrap-4-alpha-6/

## Goal

Replace current version 3 bootstrap files in Site/content/static/* with
the latest version 4 (alpha release) versions, and see what happens.

## Results

* The site looks the same, as far as I can tell
* The drop down menu looks the same (messed up)
* The third version of the drop down menu no longer works

## Verdict

* Focus on fixing the second drop down menu in ../23-som_postgresql_exp
* Consider upgrading to version 4 when the final release of it comes out
