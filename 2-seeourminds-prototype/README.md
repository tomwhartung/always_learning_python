# 2-seeourminds-prototype

Experimenting with a possible replacement for seeourminds.com .

### The Goal

The goal of this project is to merge

* what we learned in the hello-world django project with
* the html5boilerplate initializr-responsive (no optionals) template

### The initializr-responsive-* directories

Downloaded these from http://www.initializr.com/ , using the middle option "Responsive"

* initializr-responsive-1-no_optionals - checked no checkboxes under "H5BP Optional"

* initializr-responsive-2-defaults - checked only defaults under "H5BP Optional"

* initializr-responsive-3-all_optionals_checked - checked all checkboxes under "H5BP Optional"

If merging the bare minimum (under 1-no_optionals) works OK, try adding in files from the 2-defaults and 3-all_optionals_checked directories as desired.
