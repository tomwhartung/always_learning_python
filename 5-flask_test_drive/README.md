# 5-flask_test_drive project

Experimenting with parts of djangoproject.com's polls app, attempting to apply the steps to a simple app that stores emails.

## References:

Bought a few new books today - Flask, PWAs, React Native - very exciting!

Gasp!  Imagine that - an actual book this time!!

## Goal:

Determine whether switching groja.com to flask would enable us to keep the navigation,
and other elements common to all pages, DRY.

### What?

DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself.

Currently groja.com is nice and simple, but any changes to the navigation
(or many other aspects of a page, such as link tags, favicon, title, etc. -
but it is the nav that is most likely to change) need to be copy-and-pasted into all pages.

I'm thinking that the templating that flask provides should make it easy to overcome this problem.

Let's try it out, and find out for sure!
