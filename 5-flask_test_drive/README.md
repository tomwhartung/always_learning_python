# 5-flask_test_drive project

Experimenting with flask, taking it out for a test drive, so to speak.

## Two READMEs

For the process we used to get jane going, see README-jane.md in this directory.

For the process we used to get bette going, see README-bette.md in this directory.
(We may skip a step, delete some meanderings about the process, etc. in this version.)

## Reference:

Going through some examples in Chapter 2 of the "Flask Web Development" book.

## Goal:

Determine whether switching groja.com to flask would enable us to keep the navigation,
and other elements common to all pages, DRY.
