# 22-som_postgres_exp

Repo for trying out using PostGres to store the results of the SeeOurMinds.com quiz.

## Installation

Started with current version of code from seeourminds.com/Site

## References

TBD.

## Goals

1. Find the best way to use Postgres to store quiz results on the site

## Notes

Try and make it so we can just drop the final versions of the files we change back into the seeourminds.com site code.

* content/???????.py

## Observations

I believe working with Postgres is going to be very similar to working with MySql.

## Requirements

TBD.
