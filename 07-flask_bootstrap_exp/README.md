# 7-flask_bootstrap_exp project

More experiments with flask, specifically flask_bootstrap.

Note that these experiments build on what we did in ../5-flask_test_drive .

## Reference:

Continuing with playing around with examples from the "Flask Web Development" book, this time from Chapter 3.

## Goal:

Ensure that switching groja.com to flask would be an improvement by enabling us to keep the navigation, GA Tags,
and other elements common to all pages, DRY.

## Start With Hello World

```
cd always_learning_python/7-flask_bootstrap_exp
cd Site/
python3 hello.py
```

Access in browser:

* http://127.0.0.1:5000/
* http://localhost:5000/

## Flask Bootstrap

Experiment with the following goal in mind:

* Decide whether we want to use flask bootstrap, or just include a link tag as we do in the current version of groja.com .

**Try both options, examine the source, and decide.**

**Note that we are moving the gallery pages to seeourminds.com .**
