# Lesson 2

Some things to note from the second class, on Tues. Feb. 7, 2017.

## Setup Notes:

Michael likes to create a separate virtual env for each project.
This seems wasteful (of diskspace) and moreover unnecessary to me at this time so I am sticking with using just the one.

Currently - as of finishing the class, but before starting the homework - we are using the one we created for the first lesson's homework.
To enter this virtual environment, enter the following command:

```
. virtualenvs/rp_1_python3_6_flask_bette.sh
```

### 1. Review

I am actively working on two sites that I am running at home:

- groja.com: a flask site
- seeourminds.com: a django site

So I am going to forego the review at this time.
