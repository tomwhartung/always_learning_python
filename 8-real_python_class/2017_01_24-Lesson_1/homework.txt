Re-try virtualenv setup.

Goal: To be able to enter a virtual env where python3.6 is the default version of python.

Note: Python3.6 is already installed

As tomh:
python3.6 -m venv flask_python3_6_bette

- gives error:
  The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not
  available.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you need to install the python3-venv
  package using the following command.
      apt-get install python3-venv

As root:
apt-get install python3-venv

- Still did not work.
- Reference:

As root:
export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
dpkg-reconfigure locales        # OK -> OK -> OK

- Still did not work.

As root:
apt-get install python3.6-venv -y

As tomh:
python3.6 -m venv flask_python3_6_bette
echo '. flask_python3_6_bette/bin/activate' > flask_python3_6_bette.sh
chmod +x flask_python3_6_bette.sh
