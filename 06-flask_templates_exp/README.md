# 6-flask_templates_exp project

More experiments with flask.

Note that these experiments build on what we did in ../5-flask_test_drive .

## Reference:

Continuing with playing around with examples from the "Flask Web Development" book, this time from Chapter 3.

## Goal:

Ensure that switching groja.com to flask would be an improvement by enabling us to keep the navigation, GA Tags,
and other elements common to all pages, DRY.

These options seem to work ok, and the -h option makes it the site available from other hosts - good to know!

## Start With Hello World

```
cd always_learning_python/6-flask_templates_exp
cd Site/
python3 hello.py
```

Access in browser:

* http://127.0.0.1:5000/
* http://localhost:5000/

## Flask Bootstrap

Compare this version to what we have in ../7-flask_bootstrap_exp .

I'm fairly certain we will go with flask-boostrap but I am just starting out and want to play and experiment a bit.
