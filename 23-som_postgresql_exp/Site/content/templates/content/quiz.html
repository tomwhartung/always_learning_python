        This is an experimental quiz,

    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>

      &sup1; We will come up with some sort of official disclaimer some day,
      for now, please just take things with a grain of salt.</p>
    <p>
      To be perfectly honest, the main reason this quiz is online at this time
        is so I can get some feedback on it.</p>
    <p>
      Most importantly, this quiz is a work in progress, and at this time
        I am not by any means ready to guarantee that it
        will give you an accurate result.</p>
    <p>
      I've had a lot of fun writing this quiz!
      It's been a real challenge to come up with the questions
       without borrowing too heavily from Briggs-Meyers and Keirsey &mdash; and
       I love a good challenge!
      And I've had even more fun with writing the code to support having a
       different type of quiz.
      Note that it allows for a varying number of options
       (rather than just two either/or options) and even allowing visitors
       to opt-out some of the more experimental questions that appear
       in longer versions.</p>
    <p>
      But it definitely needs more work!</p>
    <p>
      If accuracy is important to you, please take other quizzes and
        get a variety of opinions.
      And if you really want to learn exactly what your four letter type is,
       by all means take the
