    <h1>Disclaimer, Accuracy, Etc.</h1>
    <p>
      We will come up with some sort of official disclaimer some day,
       for now, please just take things with a grain of salt.</p>
    <p>
      To be perfectly honest, the main reason this quiz is online at this time
        is so I can get some feedback on it.</p>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="air-quotes">Most importantly, this quiz is a work in progress, and at this time
        I am not by any means ready to guarantee that it
        will give you an accurate result!</span></p>
    <h3>If accuracy is important to you...</h3>
    <p>
      If accuracy is important to you, please take other quizzes and
        get a variety of opinions.
      And if you really want to learn exactly what your four letter type is,
        by all means take the
        <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/take-the-mbti-instrument/"
           target="_blank" title="Site where you can take the real MBTI instrument">
        real MBTI&reg; instrument</a>!</p>
    <h3>
      I've had a lot of fun writing this quiz!</h3>
    <p>
      It's been a real challenge to come up with the questions
       without borrowing too heavily from Briggs-Meyers and Keirsey &mdash; and
       I love a good challenge!</p>
    <p>
      And I've had even more fun with writing the code to support having a
       different type of quiz.
      Note that it allows for a varying number of options
       (rather than just two either/or options) and even allowing visitors
       to opt-out some of the more experimental questions that appear
       in longer versions.</p>
    <p>
      But it definitely needs more work!</p>
