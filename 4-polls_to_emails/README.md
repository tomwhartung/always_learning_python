# 4-polls_to_emails project

Experimenting with parts of djangoproject.com's polls app, attempting to apply the steps to a simple app that stores emails.

### Main References:

Most of this is based on information on this page:

(1) https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/

If I need a second opinion, I will probably go to the O'Reilly book, Lightweight Django:

(2) http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032502.do

However, I am learning that the djangoproject site seems to really be the best source of information.

### The `documents` Directory

Decided to create this and put a simple "Hello world" index.html file in it.

This may come in handy some day - possibly for sharing static content between apps - especially if I already have it.

### The `Site` Directory

This directory contains the code we are writing, based on the polls app but modified for our simple email gathering app.
