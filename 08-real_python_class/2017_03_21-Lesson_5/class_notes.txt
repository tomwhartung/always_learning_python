 Interaction
=============
Reference:
   https://github.com/realpython/web-dev-for-data-scientists/blob/master/lessons/05-interaction.md

Notes:
------
(Only 15 people here tonight.)
They (Michael and Chris) will send a request for feedback.
Git suggestion: gitflow, hubflow - plugin for github, helps keep everything sane.
Will re-offer this class, probably in a more compact fashion (not so spread out).
Considering another class on maybe JS or D3, possibly deep dives into (a) python package(s).

SQLAlchemy
----------
ORM that abstracts out the peculiarities of individual databases (MySql, Postgres, etc.)
Can be some irregularities and may need to fall back on python code.

Scheduler
---------
Got it to run easily enough:

python -m scheduler


Environment
-----------
Reusing the one I created for the homework.
Added bokeh

Live coding
-----------
Copied my latest version of the homework for starting point

Missed some edits to models.py ...

Adding multiple lines to the chart:
Abstracting out the capture of the data to a helper function in app.py
named create_chart()

Notes from "writing" the chart code (stealing Karl's code from slack):
Adding in code written by Karl, copy and pasted from slack
defaultdict -if item doesn't exist, will create it with the function that is there
palettes.Category20 - up to 20 different color codes predefined in bokeh

seed data: there are five rows with "bitrex" instead of "bittrex"

Q & A
-----
Postgres on Heroku: when requested, it assigns a port and adds it to the URI

Looking at a use case for jQuery's ajax - to get the data in real time

DOM: Document Object Model - html that is in the browser

Miguel Grinberg's youtube videos are all worth watching
Has tooling for (flask) lambda something?

Static files in flask: want to put them on S3 or digital ocean, etc.

Off-topic chatting/discussions:
US east?  Typo broke the S3 nodes?  Brought down the internet (esp. reddit),
depending on their ISP.

There are some good python-related podcasts

Software Engineering Daily - good podcast

Tips from Karl:
Style convention: do not use spaces in function definitions and calls
No one else does that.
The first arg automatically passed in to any method is "self" ...
