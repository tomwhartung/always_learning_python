 Data Retrieval
================
Reference:
   https://github.com/realpython/web-dev-for-data-scientists/blob/master/lessons/04-retrieval.md

Notes:
------
Project for the next couple of classes:
Build graph to display value (exchange rates) of crypto currencies bit coins on different markets.
Goal is to determine which is the best, so we can buy low and sell high.
Services: Bitstamp, Kraken, Bittrex
See steps outined on the page referenced above

Scheduler:
  pip3 install schedule (use instead of crontab)

Get data, e.g.:
- bitstamp.net
- https://www.bitstamp.net/api/

Environment
-----------
Created a new environment, including only flask and requests:

- rp_5_class_4_bette

Heroku
------
Run on heroku (!)
Installation instructions:
   https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
Heroku works using git
   Set up a different remote
git remote -v   # to see what the current remote is
heroku create   # sets up an app on heroku
                # sets up a remote - a link to a repository
Each individual project should be in its own github repository
Created this in /var/www/always_learning/heroku/realpythonclass/class_4
1. copied current version of code to this dir
2. Ran commands in above directory:
   git init
   heroku create
   git remote -v   ## heroku	https://git.heroku.com/tranquil-fortress-44073.git (fetch)
                   ## heroku	https://git.heroku.com/tranquil-fortress-44073.git (push)
   ## For contrast, run `git remote -v` in another repository
3. .gitignore lesson
-  dependencies
-  system files
-  sensitive security info (passwords, api keys, etc.)
4. Ran commands
   git add -A
   git commit -m 'Init'
   git push heroku master     ## NOTE: "heroku" NOT "origin"
5. Got error:
   To https://git.heroku.com/tranquil-fortress-44073.git
    ! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
   error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/tranquil-fortress-44073.git'
6. URL results (https://git.heroku.com/tranquil-fortress-44073.git)
   redirects to:
7. Create a proc file:
   Reference: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile
   vi Procfile:
   web: python app.py
   DO NOT RUN IT IN PRODUCTION LIKE THIS
8. Running heroku commands, e.g., to look at the log files
   heroku logs
   heroku logs --tail   ## Ctrl-C to exit
   heroku help
   heroku restart
   heroku ps:scale web=1
   heroku open
   heroku run ls
9. Troubleshooting
   Flask runs on port 5000 by default
   Heroku exposes a random port, we have to bind to that within 60 secs.
   Must find out which port this is ... (heroku help)
   heroku config   ## https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars
10. Need two apps running at the same time: web and data gathering
   Using a shell script
   vi Procfile
   web: sh build.sh
   vi build.sh

Suggestions:
------------
-> Cookie-cutter: use to generate a project
   There is a cookie-cutter for flask
-> Json prettify - chrome plugin to make json look good in browser
   Will mess it up if you try to copy and paste it (turn off plugin)
-> When preparing for interviews or before talks, etc.
   Talk it through out loud, it will help you find errors, etc.
-> pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
   To keep track of what we have installed in our virtual env
-> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   To install dependencies used in a virtualenv
-> Do NOT run dev server in production
   Use (install) gunicorn instead
-> heroku free tier can be slow
   They want you to upgrade to $7/month plan
-> If you gitignore the db, need to create the db on heroku
   heroku run python db.py
